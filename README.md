   ESSENTIALS OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT, Third Edition, is a brief version of the authors' market-leading text STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT: AN INTEGRATED APPROACH, helping students identify and focus on core concepts in the field in a more succinct, streamlined format. Based on real-world practices and current thinking, the text's presentation of strategic management features an increased emphasis on the "business model" concept as a way of framing the issues of competitive advantage. Cutting-edge research, new strategic management theory, and a hands-on approach allow students to explore major topics in management, including corporate performance, governance, strategic leadership, technology, and business ethics.
